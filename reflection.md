## Hackathon Reflection

This project was created during a data hackathon using
UIDAI Aadhaar enrolment and update datasets.

### What I worked on
- Understanding lifecycle-based update patterns
- Cleaning and structuring raw datasets
- Designing metrics to represent system stress
- Interpreting results beyond raw numbers

### What I learned
- Real-world data is messy and inconsistent
- Data cleaning is critical before analysis
- Time constraints force prioritization
- Clear interpretation matters as much as code
